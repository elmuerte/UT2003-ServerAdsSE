# UT2003-ServerAdsSE

Another remake of a great UT server add-on. ServerAdsSE gives you the ability to display messages/advertisements on the server (in the chat console, or on the middle of the screen). One of the biggest new features of this version is the ability to specify an URL where ServerAdsSE should download the latest messages.
